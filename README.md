What if draw in battle?
In case of draw - in a battle of cards of the same strength, each player places one facedown card into the battle and then another card to be compared in the resolving battle. 
In this case, the winner of the battle will take the 6 participating cards and place them at the bottom of his pile. 
In the event of another tie, the procedure is repeated until the battle is resolved or one player's cards are finished.

The game is finished when one player is out of cards. In this case, the other player wins the game.
